this is very much overrated i guess it carries some nostalgic value for many people it has its moments , but every scene is heavily overacted and the plot is quite shallow with this cast it could have been much better  >> 0 ||| 25 4 4-5 18-25 31 0-7 1-5 0-5 28 6 32-40 30-31 27-28 29-31 36 32-36 26-28 8-40 24 6-7 8-31 35-36 34 8-28 32-34 11-12 39 3 37 11 12 38 8-25 0 20 32-33 22 33 19 18-24 14 40 32 20-21 27 1-3 26 29 23 13 1 21 9 5 11-16 35 7 15 2 16 30 1-2 17 18-22 18-21 18 8 18-19 9-10 8-16 8-17 10 8-10  >> 0
